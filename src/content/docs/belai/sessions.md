Every conversation with Belai is a session, kept on disk as a transcript and, while you are signed in, mirrored to the console. See [Session sync](/workforce/session-sync/).

## Commands

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/resume` | Resume a session by id, or browse sessions on disk |
| `/tree` | Browse this session as a tree: continue from an earlier point, or fork a branch |
| `/compact` | Summarise the session into a new one, to free context |
| `/export` | Write this session, or one by id, as Markdown |
| `/rename` | Rename the session |
| `/clear` | Start a new session |
| `/exit` | Quit, and print the card to resume it later |

From the command line, `belai -resume ID`, `belai -continue` and `belai -export ID` do the same.

## Keeping the context small

Most of what an agent sends a model is tool output: build logs, test runs, web pages. Belai keeps it from filling the context window:

- Oversized results are stored aside and replaced with a preview. The model can read the rest with `ReadResult` when it needs it.
- Long shell output keeps its head and tail.
- Web pages are read through a role that extracts what was asked for.

All of this keeps the start of the conversation unchanged, so the provider's prompt cache keeps working. The `offload` settings tune it.

## Plan progress

`/todos` shows the session's own plan: the steps the agent set out and which are done.

## Session intelligence

`f12` or `/intel` shows plan limits, pace, trend and runway for the model you are using. See [Token budgets](/belai/token-budgets/).
