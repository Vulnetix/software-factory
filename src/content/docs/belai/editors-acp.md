`belai acp` runs Belai as an [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) agent on standard input and output. Editors that speak ACP can use Belai as their agent, with the same classifier, permission rules, guardrails and budgets as the TUI.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-provider` | Provider. Default: as for the TUI. |
| `-model` | Model. Default: the provider's. |
| `-no-transcript` | Keep no transcript of editor sessions |

## Editor setup

| Editor | How |
|---|---|
| Zed | Add Belai as an agent server, with the command `belai acp` |
| JetBrains IDEs | Add a custom agent that runs `belai acp` |
| Neovim | An ACP client plugin, pointed at `belai acp` |
| Emacs | An ACP client package, pointed at `belai acp` |
| VS Code | An ACP extension, pointed at `belai acp` |

Editor sessions are named after the editor and, when session sync is on, are mirrored to the console's Sessions list. The website cannot send prompts or answers to them: the editor owns the conversation.
