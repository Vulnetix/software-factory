A plugin bundles skills, hooks, saved prompts and agent profiles, so they can be shared and installed together from a git repository or a local directory. A manifest at the plugin's root lists what it contains.

## Commands

```sh
belai plugin install <git-url|dir>
belai plugin list
belai plugin update NAME
belai plugin disable NAME
belai plugin enable NAME
belai plugin remove NAME
```

`install` lists what the plugin contains and asks before installing. `-yes` installs without asking; the listing is still printed.

`/plugin` in the TUI lists, enables, disables and removes plugins.

## What a plugin can do

A plugin's components load like your own: its skills, prompts and profiles appear beside yours, and its hooks run like your hooks. They go through the same validation, so a plugin cannot do more than the same files written by hand.

> [!CAREFUL] A plugin's hooks are code
> Read a plugin's hooks before you install it. They run on your machine at the events they name.
