A state step points at data the run reads or writes. It makes the data part of the graph, so the builder, the run trace and the evidence pack all show where the run kept its state.

| Key | Values |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `s3_object`, `postgres_table`, `kanban_card` |
| `ref` | the object name, table name or card name, at most 300 characters |

`kind` is required.

| Kind | What the step does |
|---|---|
| `s3_object` | Writes `state/<ref>.json` under the run's storage folder, holding the run, repository, node and time. |
| `postgres_table` | Accepted by the validator, but the engine does not support it: the step is skipped, which ends its branch. |
| `kanban_card` | Makes the card named by `ref` (or finds it if it exists), labelled `factory` and `wf-<slug>`. |

The run page lists the storage folders that hold a step's output and the rows that belong to the run, under Storage.
