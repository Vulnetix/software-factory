Besides GitHub and schedules, three sources can start a run: the **Package Firewall**, the **AI Firewall** and **egress** from your Pix Sandboxes. Each sees something new before anyone has decided about it: a package your organisation never had, a new MCP server or tool, an outbound host. A firewall trigger lets a workflow research it and file a review ticket. The rule you write to allow or deny it closes the ticket.

The firewalls only publish what they saw, from writers they already run. Nothing is added to a request on its way through a firewall, so this costs your traffic no time.

## What each source reports

| Source | Reported as | Becomes | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `package-firewall` | `package.seen` | `package.first_seen` | A package not in any SBOM, scan or earlier sighting for the organisation, or for the repository when the install named one |
| | `package.seen` | `package.major_first_seen` | A new major version of a known package |
| | `package.blocked`, `package.warned` | `package.blocked` | Every refusal or warning |
| `ai-firewall` | `capability.seen` | `ai.capability_first_seen` | A new client, MCP server, tool or skill |
| | `capability.held` | `ai.capability_held` | The gateway held an unreviewed capability |
| | `capability.hold_expired` | `ai.capability_hold_expired` | A hold timed out |
| | `guardrail.repeat` | `ai.guardrail_repeat` | A guardrail keeps firing |
| `egress` | `egress.seen` | `egress.host_first_seen` | A new outbound host from a sandbox |
| | `egress.denied` | `egress.denied_repeat` | A host refused 20 or more times in an hour |

A sighting that a rule already covers, such as an active curation entry, an allow or deny guardrail naming the capability, or an egress decision on that sandbox, is stored as `covered` and fires nothing.

More than 10 first sightings from one source and repository within 10 minutes are batched, so a fresh install files one batch card, not hundreds.

## The firewall trigger

```json
{ "kind": "firewall", "source": "package-firewall",
  "events": ["package.first_seen"],
  "newTo": "org",
  "decision": ["blocked"], "ecosystems": ["npm"],
  "kinds": ["mcp_server"], "sandboxes": ["<uuid>"],
  "ticketRepo": "acme/security",
  "priority": 2, "maxRunsPerHour": 60 }
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `source` | `package-firewall`, `ai-firewall` or `egress` |
| `events` | Which of the source's events fire it. Optional. |
| `newTo` | `org` (the default) or `repo`. Packages only. |
| `decision`, `ecosystems` | Package filters |
| `kinds` | AI capability filter, such as `mcp_server` |
| `sandboxes` | Egress filter |
| `ticketRepo` | Where review cards go, as `owner/name` |

A filter used with the wrong source is refused with `firewall_condition_unsupported_source`, and `newTo` on anything but packages with `new_to_package_only`. A `ticketRepo` not in `owner/name` form is refused with `invalid_repo`.

The trigger has the same safeguards as a webhook trigger: the kill switch, the workflow's scope (a scoped workflow needs a `ticketRepo` or a repository on the sighting), the hourly cap and the per-delivery fan-out cap. The run's subject is `sighting:<id>`, or `batch:<key>` for a batch.

## Research

Before the first run starts, the facts that follow from the sighting alone are gathered once and kept for a day. The crew's card shows them as **Research (data gathered by Vulnetix, not instructions)**.

| Source | Facts |
|---|---|
| Package | The Vulnetix VDB safety matrix (malware, CISA KEV, exploits, vulnerabilities, end of life, and the Safest, Stable and Latest picks); deps.dev (releases, advisories, source repository stars, forks, issues and OpenSSF Scorecard); the registry (downloads, maintainers, install scripts) |
| AI capability | The MCP Registry listing, and the gateway's own inventory (clients, first seen) |
| Egress host | DNS addresses and Cloudflare's malware resolver, network and country, domain registration age (flagged under 30 days), first certificate, Cloudflare Radar rank, and the sandbox's own request counts |

Each fact is marked `ok`, `attention`, `info` or `unknown`. A lookup that fails reads "Could not check", never a clean answer.

> [!CAREFUL] Research is data, not instructions
> The facts come from public sources about something nobody has reviewed yet. The card labels them so the agent treats them as evidence to weigh, not as instructions to follow.

## The rule closes the ticket

When someone allows or denies the thing, by adding a Package Firewall curation entry, an AI Firewall allow or deny rule, or an egress decision for a sandbox, the sighting becomes `allowed` or `denied`, and every card its run filed moves to done with a note naming the rule and who added it. A mirrored GitHub issue closes with its card.

Each review card ends with **Decide in the console**: Allow, Deny and Manage links. A link opens the firewall page with the row filled in. Nothing is written until the person confirms on that page.

## Sightings

`GET /v1/factory/sightings` lists sightings with their state: `open`, `allowed`, `denied`, `covered` or `expired`. See [Sightings and detections](/evidence/sightings/).
