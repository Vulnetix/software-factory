Your library keeps the things worth keeping when a machine is wiped or a second one is set up: agent profiles and crews, and **library items**. The Library page (`/resolve/belai-library`) lists them, the hosts that hold each, and every version.

Every item is one small document. Each version is write-once. The website can install an item on another connected host or take a backup from one. A host keeps working offline: the library is a copy, never what a host reads at run time.

## Kinds

| Kind | Command | Lives on a host in | Sync switch |
|---|---|---|---|
| `skill` | `belai skill` | `~/.vulnetix/belai/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | `sync.skills` |
| `prompt` | `belai prompt` | `~/.vulnetix/belai/prompts/<NNN>-<name>.md` | `sync.prompts` |
| `command` | `belai command` | `~/.vulnetix/belai/commands/<name>.md` | `sync.commands` |
| `process` | `belai process` | `~/.vulnetix/belai/processes/<NNN>-<name>.json` | `sync.processes` |
| `repo` | `belai repo` | the `repos` list in settings; clones under `~/.vulnetix/belai/repos/<dir>` | `sync.repos` |
| `budget` | `belai budget` | `token_budgets` in settings | `sync.budgets` |
| `rewrite` | `belai rewrite` | `bash_rewrite` in settings | `sync.rewrites` |
| `provider` | `belai provider` | `providers` and `firewall` in settings; keys in the credentials store | `sync.providers` |
| `mcp` | `belai mcp` | one entry of `mcp.servers` in settings; secrets in the credentials store | `sync.mcps` |
| `hook` | none | a bundle directory, `~/.vulnetix/belai/hooks/<name>/`; installed on request only | `sync.hooks` |
| `launch` | none | never on a host. See [launch configurations](/workforce/pix-sandboxes/). | none |

An item is identified by its kind and name, so the same skill on two machines is one item. An account holds up to 200 live items of one kind.

## Documents

| Kind | Format and fields |
|---|---|
| Skill | Markdown with front matter: `name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`, `compatibility`, `license`, `metadata`, `disable-model-invocation`. Keys under `belai.` are reserved: `belai.role`, `belai.contexts`, `belai.niche`, `belai.resources`, `belai.updated`. |
| Prompt | Markdown with front matter: `name`, `description`, `enabled`, `order` |
| Command | Markdown with front matter: `name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `allowed-tools`, `compatibility`, `license`, `metadata`, `disable-model-invocation` |
| Process | JSON: `name`, `command`, `args`, `options`, `env`, `cwd`, `user`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `enabled`, `order`. `stdout` and `stderr` go to `log`, `discard`, `file`, `append` or `stdout`. |
| Repo | JSON: `name`, `url`, `refs`, `dir`, `depth`, `submodules`, `auth`, `installation_id`, `visibility`, `enabled` |
| Budget | JSON: `name`, `budgets` (each `provider`, `model`, `scope`, `tokens`), `cycle_seconds`, `warn` |
| Rewrite | JSON: `name`, `rules`, `enabled` |
| MCP server | JSON: `name`, `transport`, `command`, `args`, `url`, `headers`, `env`, `secrets`, `tools`, `timeout_ms`, `sandbox`, `disabled` |
| Hook | JSON: `name`, `description`, `hooks`, plus its script files |
| Provider | JSON. See [Providers and keys](/workforce/providers-and-keys/). |

## How items travel

All of these need `belai rc` running and the Vulnetix CLI signed in.

| Action | Does |
|---|---|
| **Automatic sync** | Every 30 seconds the host hashes each item of each enabled kind and asks what to do. `push`: the library has nothing newer, so the host pushes a new version. `current`: the library has it. `diverged`: the website saved a version this host has not installed, so the host never overwrites it. `skip`: not this account's, or deleted. |
| **Backup** | The website asks a host for its copy of one item and stores it as a new version |
| **Sync from hosts** | One pass of the automatic sync, now |
| **Install** | The website installs one version of an item on a host. It replaces an item of the same name only when you say so. |
| **Scan hosts** and **Import** | Find items other agent harnesses keep, and import them. See [Importing agents](/workforce/agent-import/). |

Installing a skill, prompt or command checks it first, because it is text a model will read: it is refused if it holds harness markup, terminal escapes or other control characters, bidirectional overrides, or invisible characters that hide text. A write is atomic, the files are private to you, and a symbolic link at the target is refused.

A scan reports each candidate as `valid`, `warning` or `invalid`, with notes on what was `mapped`, `dropped`, kept as `metadata`, or raised as a `warning`.

## Sync switches

Each kind has a switch under `sync`, on by default and never on while `sync.enabled` is off. A project's settings may turn one off, never on. An off switch means nothing of that kind is hashed, advertised, pushed or installed. `sync.processes` matters most: a process is a command Belai runs, so turning it off keeps the website out of what runs on the host.

## Commands

```sh
belai skill list [-json]
belai skill validate FILE
belai skill import [-force] FILE
belai skill export [-force] NAME [FILE]
```

`belai prompt`, `belai command`, `belai process`, `belai repo`, `belai budget`, `belai rewrite`, `belai provider` and `belai mcp` take the same `list`, `validate`, `import` and `export`. `belai repo` also has `sync` and `status`. `FILE` of `-` is standard input or output. `import` replaces an item only with `-force`. None of these ever reads or writes a key, and they work offline. `belai library scan` finds items kept by other harnesses.

## In the TUI

`/skills` lists installed skills. `/prompts` manages the prompt library. `/processes` manages the process library. `/commands` lists your custom slash commands, and `/<name>` runs one.
