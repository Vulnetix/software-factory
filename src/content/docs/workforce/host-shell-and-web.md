## Shell lines from the web

With `belai rc --web-shell` (on by default on a Pix Sandbox), the session page can run one shell line at a time on the host:

- **From the composer**, `!cmd` runs the line and attaches its output to the model's next turn, but only once the classifier has found it safe.
- **From the console drawer**, the output is for you only and never goes to the model.

A line runs under the same permission rules and OS sandbox as the TUI's `!cmd`, and lands in the session's transcript. Without `--web-shell`, shell lines are refused.

## Git sync

**Sync with main** on the session's git strip rebases the session's branch onto the default branch before the first turn, and before the first turn after a commit, when the tree is clean. It is the same as `git.sync` in settings, for that session. **Re-check on GitHub** reads the pull request and its checks live, for 1 GitHub call.

A sync before a turn ends as `synced` (brought up to date), `current` (already up to date), `skipped`, `conflict` (the rebase conflicted and was aborted, so nothing moved) or `error`.

## Web sessions

A session started from the website runs on the host exactly as if it were typed there. You can follow it, prompt it and answer its questions from the session page. See [Sessions](/runs/sessions/).
