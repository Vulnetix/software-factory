An agent stops to ask when it needs a person. Its session waits, the question shows as a `question` checkpoint on [Checkpoints](/decisions/checkpoints/) and in Needs you, and you answer it from wherever you are.

## Kinds of question

| Kind | Asks |
|---|---|
| `permission` | May I run this tool call? Answer allow once, allow always, or deny. |
| `clarify` | A question about the task. Answer in words. |
| `plan_review` | Here is my plan. Approve, or say what to change. |
| `mode_choice` | Which mode should I work in? |

## Answering

- **The session page** shows the question beside the transcript, with the answers it accepts.
- **The TUI**: the question appears in the session, and `/inbox` lists every card waiting on you: held at a checkpoint, assigned to you, or blocked.
- **A Pix call**: Pix reads it to you and answers with `answer_agent_question`. By voice, a permission is allow once or deny, never allow always.
- **A notification** can carry buttons that answer it.

Questions that nobody answered show in the Events page's unanswered view.

## When agents do not ask

Workers that a workflow or schedule starts, and sessions Pix starts on a call, run with permission asks off unless `belai.ask_permission` is on: a tool call the rules would ask about is allowed, and guardrails still apply. See [Autonomy](/control/autonomy/).

## Permission rules

`/permissions` in the TUI edits the tool permission rules: allow, ask or deny per tool and pattern, in your global settings and the project's. See [Guardrails](/belai/guardrails/).

## Permission offers

When a prompt states a permission the AI Firewall can enforce, for example "don't send anything to pastebin", Belai offers matching guardrail rules on a card. It writes the rule to your AI Firewall only when you apply it, or automatically with `firewall.permission_auto_apply` on. A project's settings can switch offers off, never on. A Pix Sandbox lists its offers on its page.
