A **dispatch** asks a host to start something: a session in a directory, a worker for an agent profile, or a whole crew. The factory's crew steps make dispatches, and so do the console's **Start on** buttons, the Pix buttons and Pix calls.

A host picks up dispatches over its open connection, acknowledges each, and starts the work. The acknowledgement carries the session id, which is how a crew step follows its session.

## What a dispatch carries

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| What to start | A session, a worker of a profile, or a crew |
| Directory | Where to run. For a self-hosted machine that can clone, a repository to clone instead. |
| Mode | `goal`, `agent`, `plan` or `code` |
| Model | Provider and model, or a built-in label |
| Brief | The task |
| Budget | Per-card limits that override the profile's |
| `stay` | Workers wait for work instead of exiting when the board is empty. The factory always sets it. |
| `ask` | Whether the session stops for permission asks |
| Trigger | What started it: a workflow run, a Pix call, the console, a finding, a pull request or the fleet view |
| Replicas | How many workers to start for one profile |

A host that is full refuses with its worker cap, and the factory tries the next host. See [Waiting for a machine](/runs/waiting-for-a-machine/).

## From the console

The Workforce page's **Start on** chooses a host and starts an agent there. A session's page can send prompts, answers and commands to a running session. Pausing and stopping go through dispatches too.
