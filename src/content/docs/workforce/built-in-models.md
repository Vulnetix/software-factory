Your plan includes two model **labels**:

| Label | For |
|---|---|
| Pix Smart (`pix-smart`) | Harder work: coding, planning, review, images |
| Pix Fast (`pix-fast`) | Quick work |

You only ever see the label. Behind each, Vulnetix ranks up to five Workers AI models. Every call is routed across them by recent performance: answers, refusals and speed. If the first is struggling, the call goes to the next. Model ids never appear in your console, sessions or errors.

## Allowance and windows

Each tenant has an allowance of built-in tokens a month. The window is the UTC calendar month: it starts at 00:00 UTC on the 1st and resets at 00:00 UTC on the 1st of the next month. Refused and failed calls do not count. When the allowance runs out, the factory does what `onAllowanceExhausted` says: fall back to your own keys, pause, or buy a top-up. See [Model routing](/cost/model-routing/).

The factory's share of the allowance is `budget.factory_share` (75%), and `pix.reservePercent` (20%) is kept for your own sessions.

## Hosts

The Belai build in a Pix Sandbox carries a built-in provider that offers Pix Smart and Pix Fast, so its sessions can pick either like any provider. Pix Smart takes image input; Pix Fast does not.
