When something looks wrong, there are five stops, from narrowest to widest reach. Each keeps as much as it can.

| Stop | Where | Stops | Keeps |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stop a session** | A Pix call (`propose_stop` then `stop_session`), or the session page | One session | Everything else |
| **Pause all automations** | The cockpit | Every trigger. No new step starts. | Steps already running finish. |
| **A2A blackout** | The cockpit and Settings | Messages relayed between your hosts | Coordination on each host, and every host's audit log |
| **Stop the factory** | Settings | Running steps are cancelled, leases released, forge tokens revoked, wake schedules cancelled | Interactive sessions people started |
| **Stop machine** | Pix Sandboxes | Destroys the sandbox container | Work already pushed |

> [!CAREFUL] Stopping a machine loses anything not pushed
> Destroying a sandbox container ends every session on it. Commits that were not pushed are gone. Try the narrower stops first.

## On a call

Pix can stop sessions, after reading back exactly which session it will stop and hearing your yes. It cannot pause the factory or destroy a sandbox: those are on the cockpit, Settings and Pix Sandboxes, where you can see what they will affect.
