## What is kept

What was said on a call, and the cards the page showed (actions, tables, read-backs and how each was settled), are kept, so you can read a call again, download it, rate it and call about it.

**Never kept**: audio, your IP address, your location, and the names of the models involved. A table is kept up to 50 rows and 50 tables a call; a call up to 1,500 events.

## The archive

Past calls are in **Logs › Pix calls**, and in the call page's **Past calls** chip. Both list calls, newest first, with search and a date range. Older Pix chats from the retired chat drawer are listed too, marked as such.

Each past call has **Call Pix**, which starts a new call about it: Pix knows what was said and can pick up where it left off.

You can give a thumbs up or down on each of Pix's replies; a thumbs down offers an optional note.

## Memory

Pix keeps notes between calls only when you ask, or when you state a lasting preference: "remember that I always want plan mode on vdb-site". It can search them and delete one when you ask, saying which note first. The 15 most recent notes go into each call. Notes never hold anything Pix overheard; only what you asked it to keep or told it as a standing preference.

> [!WHY] Why Pix remembers only on request
> A call often includes things you would not want repeated next week. Keeping only what you ask for means you always know what Pix knows.

## Every call is a record

Each call is also logged to the factory's call log, so [Delivery](/evidence/delivery/) can count the time people spend directing the factory by phone (`delivery.sources.pixcall`).
