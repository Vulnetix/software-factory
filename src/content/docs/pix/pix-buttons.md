Some console pages have a button beside an object, such as a failed run, a blocked build or a board card. It opens a Belai session on that object's repository with the request already written. The button names what it will do, for example **Find out why this run failed**.

**Nothing starts by itself.** The button opens the new session dialog with the prompt, mode and branch filled in. You read it, change it if you like, and press **Start**.

## What happens when you press it

| Situation | The button |
|---|---|
| One place can run it | Opens the dialog for that host or Pix Sandbox |
| Several places can | Shows a short menu: Pix Sandbox or self-managed hosts |
| Nowhere can run a session yet | Says so, with a link to get or open a Pix Sandbox |
| The repository is not on any host | Says so, with a link |

A button only appears when the object names a repository a session could work on.

The session records that it was started from the console, so it shows as such on the Sessions list. See [Sessions](/runs/sessions/).
