This page names the parts of the factory and how they connect. Each section links to the page that covers its part in full.

## Scope: what the factory may touch

The factory acts only inside **managed orgs**: GitHub App installations that an owner or admin has switched on. A repository inside a managed org can have its own settings row, with an autonomy level, a board mode and a monthly token cap. A repository with no row runs at the tenant's `autonomy.default`. See [Managed orgs and repositories](/control/managed-scope/).

## Autonomy: how far it may go

Autonomy is a ladder of four levels:

| Level | The factory may |
|---|---|
| `observe` | Read and record. It writes nothing to GitHub. |
| `suggest` | Comment and post reviews. |
| `draft_pr` | Open draft pull requests. |
| `auto_merge_low_risk` | Approve a pull request once it is ready. A person still merges. |

`autonomy.max` caps every repository, and each workflow default states the level it needs. See [Autonomy levels](/control/autonomy/).

## Workflows and runs

A **workflow** is a graph you draw in the builder or start from a [template](/workflows/templates/). It has nodes, edges between them, limits (tokens, concurrency, GitHub calls) and a scope (the repositories it applies to). You edit a draft and publish a version. Publishing runs the full validator, and only a published version runs.

A **run** is one execution of a published version. It is made of **steps**, one for each node it reaches. Runs and steps have statuses you can filter on: a run is `queued`, `running`, `waiting_approval`, `paused`, `held`, `succeeded`, `failed` or `cancelled`. See [Runs and steps](/runs/runs-and-steps/).

## The kinds of step

| Node | Decides with | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| [Trigger](/workflows/nodes/trigger/) | The event it matches | Starts the run. |
| [Scan](/workflows/nodes/scan/) | Vulnetix scanners | Find vulnerable packages, secrets, malware. |
| [Decision](/workflows/nodes/decision/) | A System One classifier with a confidence threshold | Triage: fix now, schedule, ignore. |
| [Gate](/workflows/nodes/gate/) | Deterministic checks, with no model | Tests pass, release jail clean, quality gate. |
| [Crew](/workflows/nodes/crew/) | Agents on a host | Write the fix, the test, the review. |
| [Human](/workflows/nodes/human/) | A person | Approve a plan, a merge-ready change, a budget increase. |
| [Output](/workflows/nodes/output/) | The result of the run | Draft PR, review, comment, VEX, TEA release. |
| [State](/workflows/nodes/state/) | Values carried between steps | Pass a finding or a branch name along. |

> [!WHY] Why models only decide at decision nodes
> A decision node can only choose an edge you drew, and a gate never asks a model at all. Every path a run can take is visible in the graph and can be tested with a dry run before you publish.

## Hosts, crews and agents

An **agent** is a Belai profile: a model, a system prompt, tools and limits. A **crew** is a set of agents dispatched together, up to 8 replicas, to one **host** for one step. A host is a machine running Belai: a [Pix Sandbox](/workforce/pix-sandboxes/) that Vulnetix runs, or your own machine connected with `belai rc`. The factory picks a host for each crew step from its `runOn` rule. If no host can take it, the step waits and the card says why. See [Hosts and placement](/workforce/hosts-and-placement/).

## The board

Work items are **cards** on a kanban [board](/workforce/board/). A card is the same record as its GitHub issue when mirroring is on. Agents claim cards, move them between lists, and leave notes. Cards that need a person carry a `checkpoint:` label.

## People in the loop

Anything that waits on a person is a **checkpoint**: an approval, an agent's question, a card held or blocked, a draft pull request ready for review. The [Checkpoints](/decisions/checkpoints/) page lists them oldest first, and the cockpit's Needs you panel shows the head of that queue. You can answer most of them by voice on a [Pix call](/pix/calling-pix/).

## Limits and money

[Budgets](/cost/budgets/) nest from the month down to a single step, and the tightest one applies. A separate [GitHub quota](/cost/github-quota/) share keeps the factory from using up your installation's API rate limit. Buttons that call GitHub show their price before you press them.

## Evidence

The [event stream](/evidence/event-stream/) is the live feed of everything that happens, kept 30 days. The [audit ledger](/evidence/audit-ledger/) is a permanent hash chain of every change. [Trust](/evidence/trust-and-slsa/) shows the SLSA level each repository reaches and exports the attestations. [Delivery](/evidence/delivery/) measures what the factory shipped, and marks each figure as measured, derived or assumed.
