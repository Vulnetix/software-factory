title: Overview
description: Software Factory runs workflows of agents against the GitHub repositories you mark as managed, and writes the results back to GitHub as draft pull requests, reviews, comments, issues and VEX.

Software Factory turns events in your repositories into work done by agents. A pull request opens, a check fails, a scanner finds a vulnerable package, a label is added, a schedule fires: the factory matches the event to a **workflow**, starts a **run**, and walks the run through the workflow's graph. Some steps are decided by a fast classifier model, some are deterministic checks, some dispatch a **crew** of agents to a machine, and some wait for a person. The last step writes the result back to GitHub.

Everything the factory does is recorded. Every step lands in the [event stream](/evidence/event-stream/), every change of state in the hash-chained [audit ledger](/evidence/audit-ledger/), and every outcome in [Delivery](/evidence/delivery/).

> [!CAREFUL] The factory never merges
> Its GitHub App has no `contents: write` permission on your repositories. The highest [autonomy level](/control/autonomy/), `auto_merge_low_risk` (shown as "approve when ready"), marks a pull request ready and approves it. A person, or your branch protection and merge queue, still merges it.

## Core objects

Most pages in these docs describe one of these. The console column is the page you see it on, under `https://www.vulnetix.com/resolve/`.

| Object | What it is | Console |
|---|---|---|
| Managed org | A GitHub App installation the factory may act on. Nothing outside a managed org is touched. | `factory-repos` |
| Workflow | A versioned graph of nodes and edges with limits. Drafts are edited; a published version runs. | `factory-workflows` |
| Run | One execution of a published workflow version, made of steps. | `factory-runs` |
| Decision | A step where a System One model picks one of the outcomes you listed. | `factory-workflows` |
| Crew | Agents dispatched together to one machine for one step. | `factory-workforce` |
| Card | A unit of work on the board. A card and its GitHub issue are one record. | `factory-board` |
| Checkpoint | Anything waiting on a person: an approval, an agent's question, a held or blocked card. | `factory-checkpoints` |
| Budget | A token, call or USD limit on the month, day, workflow, run, step, repository or org. | `factory-budgets` |
| Audit entry | A hash-chained record written in the same transaction as the change it describes. | `factory-audit` |

## What happens in a run

1. **A trigger fires.** A webhook, a cron schedule, a scanner finding, a label, a card moving on the board, or a manual start. Debounce and the hourly run cap are checked first.
2. **The engine checks holds.** If the factory is paused or stopped, or a maintenance window or schedule blackout is in force, the run waits as `held`. It is not dropped.
3. **Nodes run in graph order.** A [decision](/workflows/nodes/decision/) picks an edge, a [gate](/workflows/nodes/gate/) passes or fails without a model, a [crew](/workflows/nodes/crew/) leases a machine and dispatches agents, a [human](/workflows/nodes/human/) node waits for a person.
4. **Anything that needs a person becomes a checkpoint.** The run waits as `waiting_approval` and shows on the [Checkpoints](/decisions/checkpoints/) page and the cockpit's Needs you list.
5. **[Output](/workflows/nodes/output/) nodes write to GitHub**: a draft pull request, a review, a comment, a VEX statement or a TEA release.

> [!WHY] Why runs are held, not dropped
> A dropped run means a fix you expected never arrives, and nothing says so. A held run shows up, waits, and starts when the hold lifts. `schedules.missed` decides what happens to schedule fires that arrived while work was held.

## Where the work runs

Crews run on **hosts**: machines running the [Belai](/belai/install-and-sign-in/) agent harness. A host is either a [Pix Sandbox](/workforce/pix-sandboxes/), a container Vulnetix runs for you, or a machine of your own connected with `belai rc`. The factory picks the host for each step from the step's `runOn` setting and the [placement rules](/workforce/hosts-and-placement/).
